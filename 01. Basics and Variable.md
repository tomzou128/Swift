# Basics
Include: Dictionary, Optionals, willSet/didSet, Assert and Precondition.

## Dictionary
Create a dictionary:
```swift
var aDict = ["apple": 5, "pear": 6]
```
With default type:
```swift
var aDict: [String: Int] = ["apple": 5, "pear": 6]
```
<br>

## Optional
Optional variable can hold ```nil``` values. ```!``` actually reminds us that this value maybe nil, so we should be more careful and conduct some checks.
```swift
var name: String? = "Sam"    // Create
print(name!)    // Use ! to force open the variable
```
If we assign a unwrapped value to another variable, then the type of this variable is not optional
```swift
var name2 = name!    // Type of name2 is String not String!
```

### 1. Force Unwrapping
We know the variable must have value when we use it, so we just force unwrap it.
```swift
let name2 = name!
```
### 2. Check for nil value
Use ```if``` to check.
```swift
if name != nil {
    let name2 = name!
    ...
}
```
### 3. Optional Binding
Checking for nil value is so commonly used, so Swift provide Option Binding for us to use. We can work safely with temporary constant ```name2``` inside the scope if ```name``` is not ```nil```.
```swift
if let name2 = name {
    
}
```
### 4. Nil Coalescing Operator
We want to assign use a default value in case it is the optional variable is ```nil```.
```swift
let name2: String = name ?? "Defalut text"
```
### Optional Chaining
Optional Chaining are for accessing variable and method in structure and class. If we directly use ```apple!unitPrice``` and ```apple``` is nil, it will crash. But if we use ```apple?.unitPrice```, it will just return nothing.
```swift
struct fruit {
    var unitPrice = 10
}
let apple: fruit?
apple = nil
print(apple?.unitPrice)
```

<br>

## willSet and didSet
```willSet``` and ```didSet``` can be assigned to a variable. The code in ```willSet``` will run before variable change, and code in ```didSet``` will run after variable change.
```swift
var m = 0 {
    willSet {
        print("value before change: \(m)")
    }
    didSet {
        print("value after change: \(m)")
    }
}
```
</br>

## Assert and Precondition
Assert and Precondition are used to stop the program when a condition is not fulfilled (usually due to error).

### Assert
The line will stop the whole program if ```age >= 0``` is false, and show the text in terminal. Assert only works when optimization level is 'No'.
```swift
let age = -3
assert(age >= 0, "Error, age negative")
```
<br>

### Assert failure
This is used when you have already checked the condition and just want to stop the program.
```swift
if age > 10 {
    print("You can ride the roller-coaster or the ferris wheel.")
} else if age > 0 {
    print("You can ride the ferris wheel.")
} else {
    assertionFailure("A person's age can't be less than zero.")
}
```
<br>

### Precondition
Similar to Assert, it also has ```precondition failure``` function. </br>
Different to Assert, precondition will run under all optimization level other then 'Ouncheced'.
```swift
let age = -3
precondition(age >= 0, "Error, age negative")
```
<br>

### fatalError
Just want to stop the program.
```swift
fatalError("Unimplemented")
```
