## Sound Play
```swift
import UIKit
import AVFoundation

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    var player: AVAudioPlayer?
    
    @IBAction func keyPressed(_ sender: UIButton) {
        playSound()
    }
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }

    func playSound() {
        // Looking for a resource called "C.wav" in the disk area allocated for our app
        guard let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "C", withExtension: "wav") else { return }

        do {
            // Normally the app can't play sound when it is silenced, so we need to change its sound category to play sound.
            // .playback means this sound is important, it can play when phone is silenced.
            try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.playback, mode: .default)
            try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true)

            // The following line is required for the player to work on iOS 11. Change the file type accordingly
            player = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url, fileTypeHint: AVFileType.mp3.rawValue)

            // iOS 10 and earlier require the following line:
            //player = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url, fileTypeHint: AVFileTypeMPEGLayer3)

            guard let player = player else { return }

            player.play()

        } catch let error {
            print(error.localizedDescription)
        }
