# Function and Closure
## Difference between function and closure
Definition differences:
```
//This is a function
func <name>(<parameters>) -> <return type> {
    <function body>
}

//This is a closure
{ (<parameters>) -> <return type> in
    <statements>
}
```
Closure doesn't have a name, and it is ususally used as a parameter in function, or for communcation between objects.
