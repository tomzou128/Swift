## Apple SwiftUI Tutorial 1: Creating and Combining Views
### 1. Create a new project and explore the canvas
Once we created a single view project, we will see the following code in ```ContentView.swift```.
```swift
import SwiftUI

//This structure conforms to the View protocol and describes the view’s content and layout.
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello SwiftUI!")
    }
}

//This structure declares a preview for that view.
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```
<br>

### 2. Customize the Text View
Command-click the text, and choose inspector. It allows you to change some attribute of the text directly. The structure changes immediately:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Turtle Rock")
            .font(.title)
            .foregroundColor(Color.green)
    }
}
```
<br>

### Combine Views Using Stacks: Horizontal and Vertical
Command-click the text view’s initializer to show the structured editing popover, and then choose Embed in VStack. Every element in this ```VStack``` will be aligned vertically.
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Turtle Rock")
                .font(.title)
        }
            
    }
}
```
Add a new text into the stack, and set the alignment of this stack to ```.leading```, which means left alignment.
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Text("Turtle Rock")
                .font(.title)
            Text("Joshua Tree National Park")
                .font(.subheadline)
        }
    }
}
```
Put the second text into a ```HStack```, and add one more text next to it. A spacer expands to make its containing **view use all of the space of its parent view**, instead of having its size defined only by its contents. Finally, use the padding() modifier method to give the landmark’s name and details a little more space.
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Text("Turtle Rock")
                .font(.title)
            HStack {
                Text("Joshua Tree National Park")
                    .font(.subheadline)
                Spacer()
                Text("California")
                    .font(.subheadline)
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```
