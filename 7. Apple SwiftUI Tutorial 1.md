## Apple SwiftUI Tutorial 1: Creating and Combining Views
### 1. Create a new project and explore the canvas
Once we created a single view project, we will see the following code in ```ContentView.swift```.
```swift
import SwiftUI

//This structure conforms to the View protocol and describes the viewâ€™s content and layout.
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello SwiftUI!")
    }
}

//This structure declares a preview for that view.
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```
<br>

Then command-click the text, and choose inspector. It allows you to change some attribute of the text directly. The structure becomes:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Turtle Rock")
            .font(.title)
            .foregroundColor(Color.green)
    }
}
```
