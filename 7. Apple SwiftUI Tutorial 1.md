# 7. Apple SwiftUI Tutorial 1

## 1. Create a new project and explore the canvas
Once we created a single view project, we will see the following code in ```ContentView.swift```. The first structure conforms to the View protocol and describes the viewâ€™s content and layout. The second structure declares a preview for that view.
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello SwiftUI!")
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```
