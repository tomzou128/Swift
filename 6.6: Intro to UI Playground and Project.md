# Intro to Playground with UI

## Default code in Xcode
```loadView()``` defines the layout of the screen. 
```swift
import UIKit
import PlaygroundSupport

class MyViewController : UIViewController {
    override func loadView() {
        let view = UIView()
        view.backgroundColor = .white

        let label = UILabel()
        label.frame = CGRect(x: 150, y: 200, width: 200, height: 20)
        label.text = "Hello World!"
        label.textColor = .black
        
        view.addSubview(label)
        self.view = view
    }
}
// Present the view controller in the Live View window
PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = MyViewController()
```

## Define a layout

```swift
import Foundation
import UIKit

public class GameViewController: UIViewController {
    
    let allCharacters = ["👦", "🐒", "🐷", "👻"]
    
    var myChoices = ["👦", "🐒", "🐷"]
    var pcChoices = [String]()
    var myChoice_labels = [UILabel]()
    var pcChoice_lables = [UILabel]()
    var gameScoreLabel = UILabel()
    var score = 0
    
    public override func loadView() {
        // Setup PC choices
        for _ in 0..<myChoices.count {
            pcChoices.append(allCharacters.randomElement()!)
        }
        
        //Setup base view
        let view = UIView()
        view.backgroundColor = .white
        
        
        let gameView = UIView()
        gameView.clipsToBounds = true    // UI stick to the border of the screen
        gameView.layer.cornerRadius = 8.0    // Set corner radius
        gameView.backgroundColor = .white
        self.view.addSubview(gameView)    //add myself to the main view
        
        
    }
    
}
```


# 6.6: Intro to Xcode project with UI

## 1. Setup a Xcode project
1. Choose 'ios', 'single view', and 'story board' as the user interface. <br>

## 2. Setup storyboard
In ```main.storyboard``` page, you can drag and drop anything you want to put into the page. <br>


### Objects in page 1
Image 1: <br>
Constraints: top, left, right and height. <br>
Label 1: <br>
Constraints: top, left, right and height. <br>
Label 2:  <br>
Constraints: top, left, right <br>
Button 1: <br>
Constraints: bottom, left, right and height. <br>

Note that Label 2 doesn't fix its height, because we don't know its height on every phone. <br>



### Objects in page 2
Image 1: <br>
Constraints: top, horizontally in container, width and height. <br>
View 1: <br>
Constraints: top, left, horizontally in container and height. <br>

Therefore, we either have **left distance fixed with horizontally in container**, or **a fixed width with horiontally in container**.
