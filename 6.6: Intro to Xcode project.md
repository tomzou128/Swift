# 6.6: Intro to Xcode project

## 1. Setup a Xcode project
1. Choose 'ios', 'single view', and 'story board' as the user interface. <br>

## 2. Setup storyboard
In ```main.storyboard``` page, you can drag and drop anything you want to put into the page. <br>


### Objects in page 1
Image 1: <br>
Constraints: top, left, right and height. <br>
Label 1: <br>
Constraints: top, left, right and height. <br>
Label 2:  <br>
Constraints: top, left, right <br>
Button 1: <br>
Constraints: bottom, left, right and height. <br>

Note that Label 2 doesn't fix its height, because we don't know its height on every phone. <br>



### Objects in page 2
Image 1: <br>
Constraints: top, horizontally in container, width and height. <br>
View 1: <br>
Constraints: top, left, horizontally in container and height. <br>

Therefore, we either have **left distance fixed with horizontally in container**, or **a fixed width with horiontally in container**.
