# 6.6: Intro to Xcode project

## Setup a Xcode project
1. Choose 'ios', 'single view', and 'story board' as the user interface. <br>
2. In ```main.storyboard``` page, you can drag and drop anything you want to put into the page. <br>
3. We need to set constraints for the objects. Normally we need to fix the top, left and right distance to its neighbour, and height for image and short labels. And fix the top, left and right distance only for long labels, since we don't know the height of it on every phone.
