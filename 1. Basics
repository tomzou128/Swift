## Assert and Precondition
Assert and Precondition are used to stop the program when a condition is not fulfilled (usually due to error).

*Assert*
The line will stop the whole program if ```age >= 0``` is false, and show the text in terminal. Assert only works when optimization level is 'No'.
```swift
let age = -3
assert(age >= 0, "Error, age negative")
```
</br>

*Assert failure*
This is used when you have already checked the condition and just want to stop the program.
```swift
if age > 10 {
    print("You can ride the roller-coaster or the ferris wheel.")
} else if age > 0 {
    print("You can ride the ferris wheel.")
} else {
    assertionFailure("A person's age can't be less than zero.")
}
```
</br>

*Precondition*
Similar to Assert, it also has ```precondition failure``` function. </br>
Different to Assert, precondition will run under all optimization level other then 'Ouncheced'.
```swift
let age = -3
precondition(age >= 0, "Error, age negative")
```
</br>

*fatalError*
Just want to stop the program.
```swift
fatalError("Unimplemented")
```
