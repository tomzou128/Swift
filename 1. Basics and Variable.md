# Basics
Include: Dictionary, willSet/didSet, Assert and Precondition.

## Dictionary
Create a dictionary:
```swift
var aDict = ["apple": 5, "pear": 6]
```
With default type:
```swift
var aDict: [String: Int] = ["apple": 5, "pear": 6]
```

## Optional
Optional variable can hold ```nil``` values. ```!``` actually reminds us that this value maybe nil, so we should be more careful and conduct some checks.
```swift
var name: String? = "Sam"    // Create
print(name!)    // Use ! to force open the variable
```
If we assign a unwrapped value to another variable, then the type of this variable is not optional
```swift
var name2 = name!    // Type of name2 is String not String!
```

## willSet and didSet
```willSet``` and ```didSet``` can be assigned to a variable. The code in ```willSet``` will run before variable change, and code in ```didSet``` will run after variable change.
```swift
var m = 0 {
    willSet {
        print("value before change: \(m)")
    }
    didSet {
        print("value after change: \(m)")
    }
}
```
</br>

## Assert and Precondition
Assert and Precondition are used to stop the program when a condition is not fulfilled (usually due to error).

### Assert
The line will stop the whole program if ```age >= 0``` is false, and show the text in terminal. Assert only works when optimization level is 'No'.
```swift
let age = -3
assert(age >= 0, "Error, age negative")
```
</br>

### Assert failure
This is used when you have already checked the condition and just want to stop the program.
```swift
if age > 10 {
    print("You can ride the roller-coaster or the ferris wheel.")
} else if age > 0 {
    print("You can ride the ferris wheel.")
} else {
    assertionFailure("A person's age can't be less than zero.")
}
```
</br>

### Precondition
Similar to Assert, it also has ```precondition failure``` function. </br>
Different to Assert, precondition will run under all optimization level other then 'Ouncheced'.
```swift
let age = -3
precondition(age >= 0, "Error, age negative")
```
</br>

### fatalError
Just want to stop the program.
```swift
fatalError("Unimplemented")
```
