# Class and object
## Define a class
Define a ```Pet``` class with 3 attributes and 1 initializer.
```swift
class Pet {
    var gender: Int
    var name: String
    var rarity: String
    
    init(gender: Int, name: String, rarity: String) {
        self.gender = gender
        self.name = name
        self.rarity = rarity
    }
}
```
<br>

## Define a child class
Define a ```Cat``` child class with parent ```Pet```. The child initializer must call its parent initializer.
```swift
class Cat: Pet {
    var cloths: [String]
    
    init(cloths:[String], gender: Int, name: String, rarity: String) {
        self.cloths = cloths
        super.init(gender: gender, name: name, rarity: rarity)
    }
}
```

### Override parent's function in child class
We need to override some functions to provide unique feature for child class. In here we assume there is a ```printme()``` function in parent class.
```swift
override func printMe() {
        print("I am a cat.")
    }

```

#### Execute both parent and child function
```swift
override func printMe() {
    super.printMe()
    print("I am a cat.")
}
```
<br>

## Create an object
Using ```Cat```'s initializer, and assign it to a variable.
```swift
var cat1 = Cat(cloths: ["T-shirt", "trousers"], gender: 1, name: "Cat one", rarity: "Legend")
```

## Copying an object
Class are passed by reference. It two variable are assigned to the same object, they are not holding two copies, but only one copy. So modifing one object will affect two variables. This is different from structure.
```swift
let cat1 = Cat(...)
let cat2 = cat1
```
