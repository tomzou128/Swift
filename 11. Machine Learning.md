# 11. Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
The training data is always labelled. Two major type of use: Classification and regression. A lot of machine learning models are reusable (i.e. digit recognition -> image recongnition)
<br>
#### Classification
Able to classify new objects to the known category, like image recognition.
<br>
#### Regression
Try to use maths/functions to simulate the relationship of some variables to the results, so that this formula can be used to estimate new results from new variables.
<br>

### Unsupervised Learning
Computer sees the structure in the datasets and differentiate the differences. Separate the data into different groups.
<br>

### Reinforcement Learning
Give computer positive and negative rewards based on its success rate. (e.g. in chess game)
