# 11. Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning
The training data is always labelled. Two major type of use: Classification and regression. A lot of machine learning models are reusable (i.e. digit recognition -> image recongnition)
<br>

### Classification
Able to classify new objects to the known category, like image recognition.
<br>

### Regression
Try to use maths/functions to simulate the relationship of some variables to the results, so that this formula can be used to estimate new results from new variables.
