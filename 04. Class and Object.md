# Class and object
## Define a class
Define a ```Pet``` class with 3 attributes and 1 initializer.
* Use classes when you need Objective-C interoperability.
* Use classes when you need to control the identity of the data you're modeling.
```swift
class Pet {
    var gender: Int
    var name: String
    var rarity: String
    
    init(gender: Int, name: String, rarity: String) {
        self.gender = gender
        self.name = name
        self.rarity = rarity
    }
}
```
<br>

## Define a child class
Define a ```Cat``` child class with parent ```Pet```. The child initializer must call its parent initializer.
```swift
class Cat: Pet {
    var cloths: [String]
    
    init(cloths:[String], gender: Int, name: String, rarity: String) {
        self.cloths = cloths
        super.init(gender: gender, name: name, rarity: rarity)
    }
}
```

### Override parent's function in child class
We need to override some functions to provide unique feature for child class. In here we assume there is a ```printme()``` function in parent class. If a parent function is overrided, it will run the child function even if it is called in parent class. You can also use ```super.printMe()``` to trigger parent function.
```swift
override func printMe() {
        print("I am a cat.")
    }

```

#### Execute both parent and child function
```swift
override func printMe() {
    super.printMe()
    print("I am a cat.")
}
```
<br>

## Create an object
Using ```Cat```'s initializer, and assign it to a variable.
```swift
var cat1 = Cat(cloths: ["T-shirt", "trousers"], gender: 1, name: "Cat one", rarity: "Legend")
```
<br>

## Copying an object
Class is passed by reference. It two variables are assigned to the same object, they won't holding two copies, but only one copy. So modifing one object will affect two variables. This is different from structure. <br>
```let``` in front of variable name won't make the value in object immutable. Because when we use methods to change the property, it won't affect the reference between object and variable.
```swift
var cat1 = Cat(...)
var cat2 = cat1
```
<br>

## Object Casting
#### Down casting(not safe):
Use only you are certain about it.
```swift
let fish = aList[0] as! Fish
```

#### Down casting(safe):
```swift
if let fish = aList[0] as? Fish {
    fish?.doSomething()
}
// or
let fish = aList[0] as? Fish
fish?.doSomething()
```
#### Up casting:
```swift
let newCell = messageCell as UITableViewCell
```
<br>

## Singleton - A static object shared in different places
```swift
class Car {
    var color = "red"
    
    static let singletonCar = Car()
}
let myCar = Car.singletonCar
myCar.color = "blue"

let yourCar = Car.singletonCar
print(yourCar.color)    // "blue"
```

## Access Level
### Standard app developer
### private
Only accessible in between the scope, e.g.: Inside a function or class.
<br>

### fileprivate
Only accessible within its swift file, since there many be more than one class in the swift file.
<br>

### internal
Default access level. Accessible inside your app module. One project can have more than one app module, e.g.: app module and pod module.
<br>

### Framework, libaray and SDK development
### public
Access is granted to other modules.
<br>

### open
Allows class and functions to be subclassed and overriden.
<br>
